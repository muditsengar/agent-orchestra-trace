# Agent Orchestra Trace

Real-time multi-agent collaboration system with detailed tracing capabilities. This project demonstrates how multiple specialized AI agents can collaborate to solve complex tasks while providing transparency into their decision-making and communication processes.

## System Overview

Agent Orchestra Trace uses a multi-agent architecture where specialized agents work together to solve complex user requests:

- **Researcher Agent**: Gathers information and conducts data analysis
- **Planner Agent**: Creates structured plans based on research findings
- **Executor Agent**: Implements solutions and generates content
- **Coordinator Agent**: Orchestrates the workflow between agents

The system provides real-time visualization of agent communication, task delegation, and the reasoning processes behind each agent's actions.

## Features

- Multi-agent collaboration with specialized roles
- Real-time trace visualization of agent communication
- Task status tracking and monitoring
- Clear view of internal agent messaging
- Responsive UI for desktop and mobile devices

## Technologies Used

### Core Framework
- React with TypeScript
- Vite for fast development and building

### UI Libraries
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- shadcn/ui for UI components
- React Router for navigation

### State Management
- Local state with React hooks
- Custom event-based state synchronization

## Detailed Deployment Steps for Local Host

Follow these steps to deploy the application locally:

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```sh
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd agent-orchestra-trace
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**
   ```sh
   # Run this command in the project root directory
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Access the application**
   Open your browser and navigate to: `http://localhost:8080`

## System Architecture

### Agent Roles

- **Coordinator Agent**: The central orchestrator that receives user requests, breaks them down into subtasks, and delegates to specialized agents
- **Researcher Agent**: Specializes in information gathering and analysis
- **Planner Agent**: Creates execution plans based on research findings
- **Executor Agent**: Implements plans and generates final responses

### Communication Flow

1. User submits a request to the Coordinator
2. Coordinator analyzes and breaks down the request
3. Subtasks are assigned to specialized agents (Researcher, Planner)
4. Each agent performs their specialized task and reports back to the Coordinator
5. Executor generates the final comprehensive response
6. Response is delivered to the user

### Rapid AI Development

This project demonstrates rapid AI development practices:

- **Component-Based Architecture**: Small, reusable components accelerate development
- **Simulated AI Framework**: Realistic simulation of AI agent behaviors without needing to integrate with external APIs
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework eliminates the need for custom CSS
- **shadcn/ui Components**: Pre-built UI components reduce development time
- **AI-Assisted Development**: The project was developed using AI coding assistants to scaffold components, generate boilerplate code, and ensure best practices

### Technical Depth

The system demonstrates several advanced concepts:

- **Task Decomposition**: Complex requests are automatically broken down into manageable subtasks
- **Conditional Execution**: Tasks are executed in the proper sequence, with dependencies managed
- **State Management**: Comprehensive state tracking for messages, traces, tasks, and status
- **Real-time Updates**: Event-based architecture provides real-time UI updates
- **Extensibility**: New agent types can be easily added to the system

### Scalability & Extensibility

The architecture is designed for scalability:

- **New Agent Types**: Additional specialized agents can be added by extending the agent types
- **Enhanced Capabilities**: Each agent's skills can be expanded without changing the overall architecture
- **Request Complexity**: The system can handle increasingly complex multi-step requests
- **Persistent Storage**: Could be extended to include database storage for long-term trace analysis

## Development Tools

- VSCode for code editing
- Git for version control
- Chrome DevTools for debugging

## Downloading the Project

To download and run this project:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Start the development server with `npm run dev`
4. Open your browser to `http://localhost:8080`

## How Agents Communicate

Agents in this system communicate through a centralized message-passing architecture:

1. Each agent has a unique ID and specialized role
2. Messages are structured with sender, recipient, content, and metadata
3. The coordinator agent manages the workflow and delegates tasks
4. Traces capture each step of the decision-making process
5. Tasks track the status of work assigned to each agent

All communication is logged and visualized in real-time, providing transparency into the collaborative problem-solving process.
