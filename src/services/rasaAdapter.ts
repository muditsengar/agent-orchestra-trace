1. Implemented strict performance profiling using Android Profiler
2. Identified several issues:
   - Excessive disk I/O during initialization
   - Too many network calls at startup
   - Inefficient layout inflation
3. Implemented lazy initialization of non-critical components
4. Added a dependency injection graph that separated startup concerns
5. Converted heavy XML layouts to programmatic views
6. Added startup sequence optimization

Result: Startup time was reduced from 6.2 seconds to 2.3 seconds (63% improvement), exceeding our target. User abandonment during startup dropped by 47%, directly impacting our key retention metrics. The techniques I implemented became part of our team's best practices documentation.

## WEEK 4 IMPLEMENTATION EXAMPLES

### DAY 25-26: INTERVIEW & NEGOTIATION PREP

#### Salary Negotiation Script:
\`\`\`
"Thank you for the offer. I'm very excited about the opportunity to join [Company] and contribute to [specific project/team].

Based on my research and experience level, I was expecting a base salary in the range of $[target salary range]. My background in [specific valuable skills] and proven track record of [specific achievement relevant to role] align well with the requirements of this position.

Would you have flexibility to adjust the base salary to better reflect my experience and the value I can bring to [Company]?"

[If they can't meet salary requirements]
"I understand there may be constraints on the base salary. Perhaps we could discuss other components of the compensation package, such as equity, signing bonus, or performance bonuses that might help bridge the gap?"

- Contribute to code reviews and architecture discussions
- Identify performance bottlenecks and propose solutions
- Begin mentoring more junior team members
- Create documentation for undocumented processes

## Days 61-90: Leading & Innovating
- Lead development of one key feature or significant refactoring
- Implement measurable performance improvements
- Present technical topic at team knowledge sharing session
- Propose long-term technical roadmap improvements
- Establish automation for repeated manual processes
- Create metrics for tracking Android app quality and performance
\`\`\`

### DAY 30: PROGRESS REVIEW

#### Job Search Assessment Metrics:
Track these metrics to gauge progress:
1. Applications submitted: ____ (target: 25-40)
2. Response rate: ___%
3. First-round interviews: ____
4. Technical interviews: ____
5. Final interviews: ____
6. Offers: ____
7. Networking contacts engaged: ____
8. Referrals received: ____

If after 30 days you haven't achieved your targets, adjust strategy:
- Increase networking focus if application response rate is low
- Revise resume if not getting interviews after applications
- Enhance technical preparation if not advancing past technical interviews
- Consider contract/freelance work to bridge employment gap
